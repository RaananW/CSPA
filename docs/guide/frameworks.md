# Other frameworks and plain DOM

Underglass is split into a runtime and adapters. `@underglass/core` is the runtime:
the GPU engine, the mount boundary, layers, motion and effects. It imports no UI
framework. `@underglass/react` and `@underglass/vue` are thin adapters over it.
Anything that can put elements in a `<div>` can use the core: plain DOM, a framework
adapter, or an Astro island that uses one of them (with a `client:only` directive,
since GPU presentation runs only in the browser).

Everything in [Concepts](concepts.md) still holds. Layers are original elements, the
GPU draws them, and native hit testing, focus and input stay on those elements.

## Vue

`@underglass/vue` is the Vue 3 adapter (`vue@^3.5`). It has the same components as
the React package, written as Vue components:

```ts
import { createCanvasHosts, mountCanvasApp } from "@underglass/vue";
import App from "./App.vue";

const gpu = mountCanvasApp(createCanvasHosts(document.getElementById("stage")!), App);
await gpu.enable();
```

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from "vue";
import { Surface, useGPUHost } from "@underglass/vue";

const gpu = useGPUHost();
const name = ref("Ada");
</script>

<template>
  <Surface id="profile" origin="center"
    :layout="{ x: 40, y: 40, width: 280, height: 160, padding: 16, direction: 'column', gap: 8 }"
    :appearance="{ background: 'white', color: '#1d1b26', radius: 16 }">
    <label for="name">Name</label>
    <input id="name" v-model="name" />
    <button @click="gpu.setTransform('profile', { rotation: 4 })">Tilt</button>
  </Surface>
</template>
```

- `mountCanvasApp(options, RootComponent, rootProps?)` creates the one persistent
  Vue app. Pass `configure(app)` in the options to install plugins (a router, a
  store) before it mounts.
- `Surface`, `Box`, `NativeScroll`, `NativeOverlay` and `Presence` take the same
  props as in React. `Presence` emits `complete` instead of calling `onComplete`.
- `useSurfaceRef({ id })` returns a callback for `:ref`; bind it to your own
  top-level element. The options may be a ref or getter.
- `useGPUHost()` and `useNativeOverlayHost()` work in `setup`.
- Vue re-applies every key of a `:style` object on each update. Never bind
  `transform`, `opacity` or `transform-origin` on a layer element: the runtime
  owns them while the GPU presents, and rewriting them turns GPU off.

The playground page `vue.html` is a complete example.

## Plain DOM

`mountApplicationModule` gives your code the adapter-owned container. Build your DOM
there, return a function that tears it down, then enroll each top-level section as a
layer:

```ts
import { createCanvasHosts, mountApplicationModule, compileStyle } from "@underglass/core";

const hosts = createCanvasHosts(document.getElementById("stage")!);
const panel = document.createElement("section");
Object.assign(panel.style, compileStyle(
  { x: 40, y: 40, width: 280, height: 160, padding: 16 },
  { background: "white", color: "#1d1b26", radius: 16 },
  true, // positioned: a layer
));
const button = document.createElement("button");
button.textContent = "Count 0";
let count = 0;
button.onclick = () => { button.textContent = `Count ${++count}`; };
panel.append(button);

const gpu = mountApplicationModule(hosts, {
  mount({ container }) {
    container.append(panel);
    return () => container.replaceChildren();
  },
});
gpu.enroll(panel, { id: "panel" });
await gpu.enable();
```

- **Updates are ordinary DOM writes.** The runtime watches the persistent root, so
  changing text, styles or children keeps GPU on and uploads fresh pixels. There is
  nothing to call after an update.
- **Layers are direct children of the container.** Enroll each one with
  `gpu.enroll(element, { id })` after it is connected, and call the returned release
  before you remove it.
- **Never move or clone the container yourself.** The runtime moves it between the
  page and the canvas; your elements, listeners and state stay where they are.
- `compileStyle` turns the typed `Layout` and `Appearance` into a style object with
  complete string values, so `Object.assign(element.style, ...)` applies it. Your own
  CSS works too.
- Motion, effects and the rest of the controller (`setTransform`, `transition`,
  `setEffects`, `disable`, `dispose`) are the same as in React.

The playground page `vanilla.html` is a complete example.

## Writing an adapter

A framework adapter has three jobs. The React adapter
(`packages/react/src/react.tsx`) and the Vue adapter (`packages/vue/src/index.ts`)
each show them in about 250 lines:

1. **Mount once.** Construct a `CanvasRuntime` with the hosts and a
   `mount(container, runtime)` callback that creates exactly one persistent framework
   root in `container` and returns its synchronous unmount. Never remount it for
   GPU changes: the runtime moves the container with `moveBefore`, which keeps the
   framework's DOM and state.
2. **Register layers.** For a typed layer component, render one `<section drawable>`
   styled with `compileStyle(layout, appearance, true)`, then call
   `runtime.register({ id, element, layout, transform, origin, decorative })` once
   the element is in the DOM. Forward later changes with `runtime.update` and
   `runtime.setOrigin`, and call the returned release when it unmounts. For refs to
   the user's own elements, use `runtime.enroll(element, { id })`. Never write
   `transform`, `opacity` or `transform-origin` on a registered element: the runtime
   owns them (it sets `transform-origin: 0 0` itself) and treats any rewrite as a
   conflict that turns GPU off. Frameworks that re-apply a whole style object on
   every update, like Vue, must leave those properties out of it.
3. **Reconcile after each update.** Call `runtime.requestReconcile()` after the
   framework patches the DOM and before the browser paints (React's layout effects,
   Vue's post-flush hooks). Calls in one update coalesce into one GPU frame.

Depend on `@underglass/core` as a regular dependency and never bundle it, so every
adapter on a page shares one runtime and one engine.

Each adapter must pass the shared browser contract in
`tests/helpers/framework-contract.mjs`: GPU stays on through content, structure and
transform updates, the canvas shows fresh pixels, native hits land on the right
elements, and `disable`, `enable` and `dispose` keep the original root and state.
